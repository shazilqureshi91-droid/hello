      <h2>Why it works</h2>
      <p>PRETTYGARDEN nails the balance between comfy and put-together. The fabric drapes nicely without clinging, the sleeves are long enough to balance the cropped hem, and the neckline is versatile for layering or wearing solo.</p>

        <li><strong>Soft, breathable fabric</strong> — all-day comfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Flattering fit</strong> — cropped but not too short; pairs with high-waist jeans or skirts.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy to style</strong> — dress it up with accessories or keep it casual.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple colors & sizes</strong> — choose what matches your vibe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Perfect for students, young professionals, or anyone who likes a low-effort look that still turns heads.</p>
