      <h2>Why people (and their nails) are obsessed</h2>
      <p>Gellenâ€™s Winter Collection feels like a soft sweater for your nails â€” think velvet reds, frosted mauves and deep chestnuts that last. The formula glides on smooth, dries to a glossy finish, and makes your hands look put together with almost no effort.</p>
      <ul class="features">
        <li><strong>Long-lasting shine:</strong> Glossy top look without the salon price.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy application:</strong> Wide brush for streak-free coverage even if you're in a rush.</li>
        <li><strong>Vibe-ready shades:</strong> Designed for quick selfies, office days, and weekend plans.</li>
        <li><strong>Wear with confidence:</strong> Looks great on short, long, natural or tips â€” instant polish upgrade.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whether youâ€™re a polish pro or someone who paints nails between meetings and episodes, these shades were made to feel effortless. No dramatic steps â€” just quick swipes and youâ€™re ready to go.</p>

    <section id="how-to" class="panel">
      <h2>How to get the most from one bottle</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Wipe nails clean and push cuticles back. A quick swipe with a little rubbing alcohol makes polish stick better.</li>
        <li><strong>Two thin coats:</strong> One thin base coat, two thin color coats. Thin coats dry faster and last longer.</li>
        <li><strong>Seal it:</strong> A quick top coat extends shine and prevents chips â€” or just let the color build on itself if youâ€™re low on time.</li>
        <li><strong>Touch up:</strong> Keep a tiny brush and the same shade for quick fixes â€” instant fresh nails.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Pro tip: If youâ€™re switching shades often, keep a gentle polish remover and a cotton pad nearby â€” easy cleanups = less stress = more fun.</p>
