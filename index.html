      <h2>Why this polish fits every mood</h2>
      <p>GELLEN Colors gives you glossy, salon-adjacent nails without the appointment. The non-toxic formula feels light, applies evenly, and dries to a high-shine finish that holds up to everyday life â€” typing, errands, coffee runs, and the little chaos in between.</p>
      <ul class="features">
        <li><strong>Non-toxic ingredients:</strong> Formulated with safer components for everyday use.</li>
        <li><strong>Even coverage:</strong> Smooth brush and pigmented color makes one coat very tempting â€” two thin coats = perfection.</li>
        <li><strong>All-day shine:</strong> Glossy finish that keeps nails looking fresh without constant touch-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessible shades:</strong> From soft nudes to winter-ready plums â€” versatile for any age or style.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whether you're a student, a busy parent, or a pro who likes to keep things polished, these shades are designed to be low-maintenance and high-impact.</p>

    <section id="how-to" class="panel">
      <h2>Simple at-home routine</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Clean nails and push back cuticles for a neat base.</li>
        <li><strong>Thin coats:</strong> Apply thin layers â€” one base, two color coats for full coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Seal and go:</strong> Finish with a top coat or let the glossy finish do the heavy lifting.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Pro tip: quick-dry sprays or drops are lifesavers when you're short on time â€” but even without them, these polishes dry fairly quickly when applied in thinner layers.</p>
